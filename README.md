This package was supposed to provide a more flexible way to generate
Moodle quizes from Julia than
[MoodleQuestions.jl](https://github.com/dmolina/MoodleQuestions.jl).
Only after writing it, I discovered another package named
[MoodleQuiz](https://github.com/tauu/MoodleQuiz), which seems to offer
approximately the same flexibility as this one, but is probably more
mature. Though, I'm not sure whether it's compatible with recent Julia
versions.

This package is work-in-progress.
